A binary shapefile loader and canvas-based renderer, for javascript. Many caveats:

Seems best in Safari... times out in IE and in Firefox 3.5 with large files. 
Error checking is strange (needs testing with more known-good files). 
Manually increments byte array offsets instead of being smart.
Implies that it's a good idea to load large binary files over the network. 
Doesn't do anything apart from proof of concept.

http://www.nihilogic.dk/labs/binaryajax/binaryajax.js is used for loading binary data via XMLHttpRequest
http://code.google.com/p/vanrijkom-flashlibs/ was ported to js from actionscript
http://code.google.com/p/explorercanvas/ is used for IE support

binaryajax.js is under MPL and  was extended to support parsing doubles

shapefile.js is such a close port of the vanrijkom-libs code that it must be LGPL v2 as well
